# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
### The purpose of this analysis is to describe statistical differences between ride-sharing markets in Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. Based on these differences, three business recommendations will be made to improve PyBer's marketing strategy and business.

## Results
### Differences in Volume of Rides, Drivers
* As seen from the summary table below, the volume of rides and drivers is highest for ubran cities, then suburban cities, then rural. 
* Total rides for urban cities is about 2.6 times higher than suburban cities, and 13 times higher than rural cities. 
* Available drivers for urban cities is about 4.9 times higher than suburban cities, and 31 times higher than rural cities.

### Differences in Average Fare per Ride, Driver
* This summary table also shows that the average fare per ride is highest in rural, followed by suburban, and urban have the lowest. This trend is also true for average fare per driver in each city type. 
* Average fare per ride is 41% higher in rural cities when compared to urban cities
* Average fare per ride is 26% higher in rural cities when compared to urban cities
* Average fare per driver is 235% higher in rural cities when compared to urban cities
* Average fare per driver is 138% higher in rural cities when compared to urban cities

### Total Fare by City Type
* Graph below depicts 4 months of ride data for each of the city types. As expected, the urban cities have the highest total fares, followed by suburban, and lowest is rural. Total fares in suburban cities is 51% lower than urban cities. Total fares in rural cities is 89% less than urban cities.

## Summary/Recommendations
* The first two recommendations would be to try to increase the number of available drivers in both suburban and rural cities. It is expected that the total number of available drivers be lower than urban, since there are less rides. However, the number of drivers does not currently scale with the number of riders. For example, the number of riders is 13x higher in urban vs rural, but the number of drivers is 31x. A goal might be to decrease this gap to increase the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities. 

* Along with the statistical example given in #1, it should also be noted that the issue could be too many drivers in urban cities. The data shows that the total number of drivers in urban cities is actually higher than the total number of rides. since this data covers over 4 months of data, it would appear that there may actually be too many drivers. Perhaps some of them could be shifted to suburban cities, or the company needs to increase its advertising to scale up to more rides with the current driver base available in urban cities.
